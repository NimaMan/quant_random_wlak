# Question

An ant leaves its anthill in order to forage for food. It moves with the
speed of 10cm per second, but it doesn’t know where to go, therefore
every second it moves randomly 10cm directly north, south, east or west
with equal probability.

1. If the food is located on east-west lines 20cm to the north and 20cm to
the south, as well as on north-south lines 20cm to the east and 20cm to
the west from the anthill, how long will it take the ant to reach it on
average?

1.  What is the average time the ant will reach food if it is located
    only on a diagonal line passing through (10, 0) and (0, 10) points?

2.  Can you write a program that comes up with an estimate of average
    time to find food for any closed boundary around the anthill? 
    What would be the answer if food is located outside an defined by
    \(( (x – 2.5) / 30)2 + ( (y – 2.5) / 40)2 < 1\) in coordinate system
    where the anthill is located at \((x=0, y=0)\)? Provide us with a
    solution rounded to the nearest integer.

# Solution

I had confusion whether the food is located on the set of points in
\(\{(0, 2), (0, -2), (2, 0), (-2, 0) \}\) or lines passing through these
points. If the question is asking for the mean time to reach the lines
passing through these points the answer is pretty straightforward. The
answer can be find using the code for the question number three which
solves a set of linear equations for the mean time to get absorbed into
these lines. Otherwise, I solve this question in the following way.

Let \(s_t = (i_t, j_t)\) denote the distance (in 10cm) of the ant on the
east-west and south-north directions at time \(t\) where
\(t \in\{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}\) denotes the number of seconds passed
since the ant has started moving. Notice that the movement of the ant
has a Markovian property as the position of the ant only depends on the
latest position of the ant. Mathematically speaking,
\[P \left(s_{t+1}=(i_{t+1}, j_{t+1}) | s_{t}, s_{t-1}, s_{0}\right) = P \left(s_{t+1}=(i_{t+1}, j_{t+1}) | s_{t}\right).\]
Markovian property states that regardless of the history of the
movements of the ant the mean number of steps to enter a given state is
only dependent on the current state or position of the ant. I will use
this property in calculating the time it takes for the ant to reach the
food on average starting from a given position.

## Question 1

Let \(Z^{A} = \{(0, 2), (0, -2), (2, 0), (-2, 0) \}\) be the set of
coordinates where the food is located and
\[V(s) = \mathop{\mathrm{\mathbb{E}}}\left[\min\{n: s_n \in Z^{A}|s_0=s\} \right],\]
be the firs time that the ant enters a state in \(Z^{A}\) (the time that
the ant reaches the food) starting from the state \(s = (i, j)\). In
order to find the mean number of steps to reach the food, I condition on
the current state of the ant. Assume that the ant is currently in state
\((i, j) \notin Z^{A}\). The mean number of steps for the ant to enter a
state in \(Z^{A}\) is equal to taking one step in a random direction
plus the mean number of steps to the enter \(Z^{A}\) from the new
states. Since we move in each direction randomly with probability
\(\frac{1}{4}\) we can write \[\label{twodmean}
    V((i, j)) = 1 +  \frac{1}{4} V((i+1, j)) + \frac{1}{4} V((i-1, j)) + \frac{1}{4} + V((i, j+1)) + \frac{1}{4}V((i, j-1)).\]
We are interested in finding \(V((0, 0))\) to calculate the mean number
of steps for the ant to reach a food. We need to solve the two
dimensional recursive equations given in Equation
([\[twodmean\]](#twodmean)) for
\(i, j \in \{ -\infty, \dots, +\infty\}\) to calculate \(V((0, 0))\).
Solving these equations maybe cumbersome. I will partition the state
space into a set of points that have the same distance to the closest
point in \(Z^A\) to simplify the problem. Define \((i^N, j^N)\) as the
nearest point in \(Z^A\) to position \((i, j)\)
\[(i^N, j^N) = \mathop{\mathrm{arg\,min}}_{(u, v) \in Z^{A}} |u - i| + |v - j|,\]
where \(|i|, |j| \geq 1\). I cluster the states into the following sets:
\[\begin{aligned}
    Z^{0} &=  \{(0, 0)\}, \nonumber \\ 
    Z^{-1} &=  \{(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)\}, \nonumber \\
    Z^{-2} &=  \{(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)\},\nonumber  \\
    Z^{d} &=  \{(i, j): |i - i^N| + |j - j^N| = d \}, \  d\geq 1.\end{aligned}\]
One step transition from each of these sets results in moving to the
neighboring sets. Following the Markovian property and symmetric nature
of the problem \(V^\gamma = V((i, j)), \ \forall (i, j) \in Z^\gamma\)
where \(\gamma \in \{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots \}\). Following a similar
logic to Equation ([\[twodmean\]](#twodmean)), the mean number of steps
to enter \(Z^A\) starting from a point in \(Z^\gamma\) can be written as
\[\begin{aligned}
\label{r1}
    V^{-2} &=  1 + \frac{1}{2}V^{-1} + \frac{1}{2}V^{1}, \nonumber \\
    V^{-1} &=  1 + \frac{1}{2}V^{-2} +  \frac{1}{4}V^{0}, \nonumber \\
    V^{0} &=  1 + V^{-1}, \nonumber \\ 
    V^{1} &=  1 + \frac{1}{2}V^{-2} +  \frac{1}{2}V^{2},\nonumber \\
    V^{d} &=  1 + \frac{1}{2}V^{d-1} + \frac{1}{2}V^{d+1}, \ \forall \in \{2, 3, \dots\}. \end{aligned}\]
After some algebra these equations can be re-written in the following
form:

\[\begin{aligned}
 \label{r12}
    V^{-1} &=  \frac{2}{3}V^{-2} + \frac{5}{3}, \nonumber\\
    V^{-2} &=  \frac{3}{4}V^{1} +  \frac{5+6}{4}, \nonumber\\
    V^{1} &=  \frac{4}{5}V^{2} +  \frac{5+6+8}{5}, \nonumber\\
    V^{n} &=  \frac{n+3}{n+4}V^{n+1} + \frac{5+\sum\limits_{j=0}^{n} (6+2(n-j))} {n+4}.\end{aligned}\]
The summation term in the above equation can be further simplified as
\[\alpha (n) = 5+\sum\limits_{j=0}^{n} (6+2(n-j)) = n^2 +7n + 11.\]
Re-writing \(V^1\) as a function of \(V^n\) we get \[\label{oneton}
    V^1 = \frac{4}{n+3} V^n + 4\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{\alpha(j)}{(j+3)(j+4)} =  \frac{4}{n+3} V^n + 4\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{\alpha(j)}{\alpha(j)+1}.\]

The summation \(\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{\alpha(j)}{\alpha(j)+1}\)
in Equation ([\[oneton\]](#oneton)) diverges to \(\infty\) as we let
\(n\to\infty\). That is to say that the average number of steps to enter
an absorbing state in \(Z^A\) starting from a point in \(Z^1\), is the
summation of infinity and the average number of steps to enter \(Z^A\)
starting from a point in \(Z^\infty\) divided by \((n+3)\). The result
of this summation is equal to infinity. Using Equation ([\[r1\]](#r1))
\(V^0\) will be equal to infinity as well. Hence, starting from the
anthill the mean number of steps to find a food is infinity.

## Question 2

I take a similar approach to the question one to find the mean number of
steps to reach the food located on the line \(i+j = 1\) starting from
\((0, 0)\). I cluster the states below the line into the parallel line
that are distance \(d\) away from \(i+j = 1\). \[\begin{aligned}
    Z^{d} &=  \{(i, j): i + j = 1 - d \}, \ for \ d \in \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} \end{aligned}\]

Starting from a state in \(Z^d\) with probability \(\frac{1}{2}\) we
move to a state in \(Z^{d+1}\) and with probability \(\frac{1}{2}\) to a
state in \(Z^{d-1}\). Similar to the previous question, letting \(V^d\)
be the mean number of steps to reach a food starting from a point in
\(Z^d\), we can write \[\begin{aligned}
\label{r21}
    V^{1} &=  1 + \frac{1}{2}V^{2}, \nonumber\\
    V^{d} &=  1 + \frac{1}{2}V^{d-1} + \frac{1}{2}V^{d+1}, \ \forall \in \{2, 3, \dots\}.\end{aligned}\]
Re-writing \(V^{1}\) as a function of \(V^n\) we get the
\[\label{one2n2}
    V^1 = n-1 + \frac{1}{n} V^n.\] Equation ([\[one2n2\]](#one2n2))
means that the average number of steps to enter any point on line
\(i+j = 1\) starting from a point on set \(Z^1\) is the sum of infinity
and mean number of time to hit the line starting from a point in
\(Z^\infty\) divided by \(n\). Hence, the mean number of points to reach
the food starting from \((0, 0)\) is infinity.

## Question 3

The mean number of steps to reach the food outside the boundary given in
question number three is 14. The code below can be used to find the
number of steps to reach the food using simulation and analytic methods.
The number of steps to reach the food can be generated either serially
or in parallel using the simulation.

It is also possible to find the exact solution by extracting the states
\((i, j)\) inside the boundary, generating the probability transition
matrix of the transient states, and solving the set of equations in the
form of Equation ([\[twodmean\]](#twodmean)).
